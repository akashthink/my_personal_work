Encapsulation in Python:-

Capsule--->
Grouping/combining data member and member function in single unit is known as Encp.

Restrict access to method and variable 

Prevent data from direct modification

Advantage:
1-Security
2-Enhancement will be easy{without affecting outside we can able to perform any type of change internally }
3-Maintainability
4-Modularity

Disadvantage:
1-Time consuming process slows the speed
2-Username/password/Otp

    def sell(self):
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price

c = Computer()
c.sell()

# change the price
c.__maxprice = 1000
c.sell()

# using setter function
c.setMaxPrice(1000)
c.sell()

Output

Selling Price: 900
Selling Price: 900
